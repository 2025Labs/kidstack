Well, think about a flashlight. Flashlights use batteries as an energy, or power, source. When you switch on the flashlight, the light comes on. The batteries in your flashlight have the capacity – or ability – to do the work of powering your flashlight. The energy stored in batteries is a form of chemical energy. The energy is provided by a chemical reaction. <br><br> Capacity is also how much work something can do. For example, two D-cell batteries might be able to power a large flashlight, but not an entire home.  Even for the flashlight, those D-cell batteries won’t last forever. Eventually the batteries will be drained and will need to be replaced. The energy capacity of a battery is limited.")

If &quot;food is fuel&quot; for our bodies, what’s the source of power for our modern devices?<br><br>Many of the household devices we own are powered by electricity. You plug a cord into the wall – for example, for a toaster – which uses the electricity provided to your house to power whatever you plugged in. That’s how we power toasters, microwaves, televisions, blenders, mixers, and other household appliances. We don’t normally think about where the energy comes from when we plug them in, but they get their energy from the “electric grid.” When you drive around town, you probably see power lines that deliver that electricity from the grid to businesses, homes, schools, hospitals, and other places. The electric grid is the way that we connect energy sources – which we will cover in the next section – with places that need energy, like houses and businesses.<br><br>Not everything is powered by plugging a power cord into the wall. Lots of things we use everyday use batteries as an energy source. Cars use batteries, too, and non-electric cars also burn gasoline for power (electric cars do plug in to a wall socket to recharge).

Everything in the world is made up of atoms. Each atom has a central particle called a “nucleus”. Nuclear energy gets its name from the fact that the power comes from the nucleus. We produce nuclear energy by splitting uranium or plutonium atoms in a process called <i>nuclear fission</i>. When these atoms are split, the action releases a huge amount of energy.  The heat created from this process is then turned into steam, which is used to turn turbines. The percent of energy production by harnessing nuclear energy varies widely by country, as the table shows.<br><br>Nuclear fission processes occur in a special structure in a nuclear power plant, called a “containment structure”, which is designed to keep dangerous radiation from escaping the plant. Nuclear processes generate something called nuclear waste.  This consists of the leftovers after nuclear fission. This radioactive waste is dangerous to people and animals, and has to be carefully disposed of. <br><br>Every once in a long while, there are accidents of some kind at nuclear power plants. Past examples include the failure of the Fukushima power plant in Japan after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, an accident in 1979 at the “Three Mile Island” power plant in the US, and the Chernobyl power plant in Russia in 1986. Each of these resulted in radioactive material released into the surrounding environment. Because of the danger of nuclear accidents, some people do not like nuclear power generation. Japan generated 30% of their power via nuclear power plants before the Fukushima accident; now Japan is largely against nuclear power, and produces less than 2% of its energy through nuclear power.")
