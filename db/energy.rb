Past examples include the failure of the Fukushima power plant in Japan after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, an accident in 1979 at the “Three Mile Island” power plant in the US, and the Chernobyl power plant in Russia in 1986. Each of these resulted in radioactive material released into the surrounding environment. Because of the danger of nuclear accidents, some people do not like nuclear power generation.
