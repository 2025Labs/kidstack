Designing and building things are not the only engineering activities. However, engineering design is often what people think about when they think about engineering.  <br><br> Engineers design things before they build them. They start with what they know about what it needs to do, as well as how it is planned be used. A good example of an engineering design problem is building a bridge. When the engineers think about how to design a bridge, they know where the bridge is supposed to go, such as across a wide river, or a narrow creek or a deep canyon. And, they know what it is supposed to carry, for example, cars and trucks, or trains, or people. As you might imagine, a walking bridge would be designed differently than a train bridge.  <br><br>You can imagine what might happen if a bridge is built incorrectly for its planned use. For example, what might happen if you build a walking bridge over a deep canyon and then drive a cement truck over it? The truck could be far too heavy for the bridge, and it could end up at the bottom of a ravine. Or if you build a very short bridge over a very wide river, your bridge users might end up in the river. Sometimes, however, engineers make assumptions about how something will be used, and then it ends up being used somewhat differently. That's a topic we'll cover another day. ")

It needs to be able to handle the weight of cars with bumper to bumper traffic, at or above 2500 cars at a time (constraint). It needs to be able to handle the weight of people occupying the full span of the bridge for festivals (constraint). It needs to be able to withstand winds of up to 60 miles per hour (constraint). It needs to be able to withstand an earthquake of up to 7.5 magnitude on the Richter scale (constraint).<br><br>If a bridge is needed in an area where there are earthquakes or hurricanes or tornadoes, then the engineers have to think about how to design the bridge to be able to withstand those types of expected events. They might spend a great amount of time thinking about designing for earthquake safety for bridges in California. But, in Florida, they’d think hurricanes. And, in Oklahoma, they would have anticipate tornados.  <br><br>By the way, engineers think not only about <i>whether</i> a particular event may occur in an area, but also how <i>strong</i> an event of that type is likely to be. For example, Japan's Fukishima nuclear power plant was designed to withstand an 8.6 earthquake. Engineers had predicted that a larger earthquake was not likely to happen. The March 11, 2011 magnitude 9.1 earthquake showed that their prediction was wrong. Sometimes designs are flawed, because perfect knowledge is never available.

It took many more years to be able to send the first telegraph message over wires. From there, it took time to figure out how to send telegrams without wires. Then, figuring out how to make voice telephone calls took additional exploration after that. Before telegraph systems and telephones were invented, people sent messages manually. For example, they sent a messenger on horseback, or sent smoke signals, or beat drums. Smoke signals and drums require the people to be close enough to see the message or hear it.

This discovery showed that chemical reactions can create electric currents. From this discovery, Volta figured out how to make a battery work. His invention, called the voltaic pile, was created around 1800. The words 'volt' and 'voltage' are named after him. <br><br>Hans Christian Orsted discovered in 1820 that a wire carrying an electric current can move a nearby magnetic needle on a compass.

Sometimes the person who built something is not around - but you need to understand how it works. Maybe it stopped working, and you need to fix it. First, you need to understand how it's supposed to work before you can fix it. Or, maybe you want to improve it so that it can do more things. Then, you need to understand how it works so that you can add new capabilities to it.")

Well, there are a few possible reasons. One might be just to learn about it and understand how it works. Imagine if you were to take apart your television… (Please don't actually do that, your parents might get mad at you!) But, if you did, you could see what the components (parts) are. Electronic components tend to have labels – called part numbers – on them to identify what they are. You can look up the components to identify their function. (You can look up just about anything online these days.) If you identify the parts and what they do, you can get an understanding of how the thing you use every day actually works. Engineering students often take apart devices for these very reasons. If you have older, broken devices hanging around your house (anything from mixers to remote controls to toasters), you might think about (safe!) ways to do a little of your own reverse engineering. But, please --- only do this with an adult's permission, and with competent adult supervision!")

Wouldn't you want to know how their spacecraft works, and whether they know something we don't about space travel? Or, imagine that a well-known company is working on its next generation smartphone. Suppose that everyone wants to find out about what it will look like, what it can do, and what great new capabilities it will have. Imagine that an engineer in the company has a prototype (early example) phone and has brought it along on a night out on the town. And, imagine the engineer somehow left it behind in a bar or restaurant. You can bet that the phone will find its way into the hands of someone who will do their best to reverse engineer everything they can to find all about the new phone. As a matter of fact, you might recognize this example as an actual news item! The actual news item was about a to-be-released Apple iPhone.")

These include figuring out how legacy devices work in order to modify them, fix them, or add something new to them. For example, a company may have an important, but old piece of equipment that is no longer supported by the company that manufactured it. (Maybe the source company no longer even exists.) The engineers will have to reverse engineer the equipment to understand how it is put together before they can make any fixes or modifications. Reverse engineering means to take something apart - physically or logically - to understand its parts and what they do, and how it functions.")
