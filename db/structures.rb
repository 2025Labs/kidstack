Or maybe you are at the library sitting at a desk watching on a computer. You might even be in a car or an airplane looking at a smartphone or a tablet. Wherever you are, you are likely sitting on a structure, like a chair, and sitting in a structure, like a building. If you are sitting in a vehicle like a car or an airplane, then you are in a machine with structural components, or parts. So what is a structure anyway?<br><br> The simplest definition of a structure is that it is something with parts put together in a particular way. From an engineer's point of view, a structure is something that is 'load bearing'. Let's take a closer look at what each of these two words mean, so we can understand what it means to be 'load bearing'.")

In the case of structures, load is another word for force. A force is a push or a pull on a structure or any other kind of object. "Bearing" might be a word you have never heard before, and it can have a few different definitions (none of them having to do with bears!). In this case, bearing means to hold up or stay strong against something. Putting these two ideas together, a structure is something that can hold up or stay strong against one or more forces, which means it will not break apart, collapse, or otherwise fall down.')

A chair's purpose is to be sat on (and maybe it's the place you put your backpack when you come home from school...). A house provides shelter. A bridge gives you a way to cross an obstacle. Each of these structures does something different, but they all have one load or force in common: their own weight. An objectâ€™s weight is the measure of the pull of gravity on that object. Before a chair can support the force of your weight, it has to support its own weight.  The same thing is true for the house and the bridge. A structure's own weight is called its 'dead load'. Any other force the object supports (like you or your backpack) is called its 'live load'.")

It wouldn't be a very useful bridge if it could support a lot of users, but blew over in the first strong wind. Depending on where the bridge is located, it might also be designed to resist the movement of the earth during an earthquake. Earthquakes and wind create environmental forces that act on structures, and they are important considerations for large structures like buildings and bridges.")

A force is a push or a pull on one object by another object. When you think about pushing or pulling something, you might think about moving it. For example you might open a door by either pushing or pulling on it. But not all objects move when you push or pull on them. If you push on a wall, you are definitely exerting a force, but unlike the door, it isn't going to move. Structures still experience the force being exerted, but since their job is to stay put, they have other ways of reacting to forces besides moving. Tension, compression and torsion are three different ways that structures respond to the pushes and pulls exerted on them.")

For example when you sit down on a swing, the force of your weight pulls down on the swing, creating tension in the swing. The chains on the swing act like a rubber band and stretch. Unlike a rubber band, you can't actually see the chain stretch because the amount of the stretch is incredibly small. Imagine instead that the chain links are made of rubber bands instead of metal. With rubber bands, you would definitely be able to see the stretch. But since the purpose of a swing is to allow you to swing, not to bounce or sink straight to the ground, it has to be built with something that stretches just a tiny amount under tension. <br><br> When you get off the swing, the chains return to their normal length. If they didn't, the swing would eventually sink to the ground, and it wouldn't be able to continue being a swing. The swing chains act just like a rubber band that returns to its original size once you stop pulling on it.  This ability to stretch and then return back to its original size is a behavior known as elasticity.")

Larger structures like buildings and bridges react to forces these exact same ways. The cables on a suspension bridge experience tension as they help support the weight of the bridge and its users. The roof of your house experiences compression if there is a lot of snow on top of it. A skyscraper can experience torsion if it twists slightly in the wind. Structures can also experience a combination of these reactions. For example a twisted swing is experiencing both torsion from the twist and tension as you are still pulling down on the chains. Tension, compression and torsion describe three ways structures respond to the different forces acting on them.")

Engineers will also need to know if the area experiences any natural events like earthquakes. All of these environmental factors will help the engineer develop a set of design constraints, or requirements, that the bridge must meet to be safe.  These requirements are called design constraints, because they will represent limitations on the design, or plan, of the bridge. <br><br> Another key design constraint is ensuring the bridge is strong enough to stand up to the forces (pushes and pulls) that will be acting it. If youâ€™ve watched the structures video, you know that if a structure is load bearing, it is designed to stand up to forces acting on it. In addition to planning for all of the environmental factors above, engineers must also plan for the bridge to stand up to, or support, its own weight â€“ its dead load â€“ along with the weight of the users of the bridge â€“ its live load. The environment also holds potential forces engineers must plan for, such as the possibility of high winds blowing against the bridge.<br><br>Along with the different forces and environmental factors, an important design constraint with every engineering project is the budget, or amount of money, available to complete the project. Materials, equipment, and labor â€“ the work done by people â€“ are expensive and will place additional restrictions on the design. Once an engineer understands all of the design constraints on building a particular bridge, she can figure out what kind of bridge design will work best.")

The deck can be made up of one or more spans. A span is the distance between two supports. The key distinction between the different types of bridges is how the deck of the bridge â€“ and therefore all of the users of the bridge â€“ is supported. Letâ€™s look more closely at three different types of bridges, the beam bridge, the suspension bridge and the arch bridge to see how they support their loads.<br><br>A beam is a horizontal structural element supported on both ends. With bridges, this beam is called a span. A beam bridge can have a single span or it can be continuous and have many spans and therefore many supports. As with all beams, each span of a beam bridge is under both tension and compression. Compression on the top of the deck from the weight of the deck and the people and vehicles using the bridge, and tension on the bottom of the deck, as the deck is pushed down from the load it is supporting. <br><br> A suspension bridge supports its deck with a pair of cables. These two cables run along the top of two towers and are then anchored to the earth at each end. Suspender cables attach the deck to these  top two cables. All of the cables are under tension (being pulled) from the weight of holding the deck up. The towers are under compression (being pushed) from the weight of cables (and the deck they are supporting) pushing down on them.<br><br>An arch bridge works by diverting the force of its load to abutments on either side of the arch. Because of its semicircular shape, every part of an arch is under compression. If you were to stand on top of arch, it would not bend under your weight like a beam would. An arch bridge can be designed as a single arch with a deck on top, or as a series of arches that are connected with a deck on top. Arch bridges can also be built with the span of the deck passing through the arch, called a through arch bridge. A through arch bridge uses cables or beams to support the deck, which work like the suspender cables in a suspension bridge.  The oldest bridges in the world that are still standing (some still in use) are arch bridges. Modern arch bridge designs look very different than ancient arch bridges, but they still rely on the strength of the arch to support their users. ")

Bridges are noted both for their overall length, and for the length of their longest span. Beam bridges are the longest bridges in the world, but a single span on a beam bridge is shorter than a single span on many of the other bridge designs. For example, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, part of the highway system in Louisiana, is 23.8 miles long, but the individual spans of its deck are only 56 feet. <br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, the longest suspension bridge in the world is the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan. Like the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge is part of a highway system. This bridge is only 2.4 miles long, but its longest span is 6,532 feet long. The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge is about a tenth the length of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, but its longest span is 116 times longer than any span on the Causeway. <br><br>These distances and lengths point out not only the differences in the bridge designs, but also the different design constraints that each bridge must meet. Bridges are a critical part of our transporation infrastructure, or system. They are each are designed to meet the unique requirements of the many obstacles that people cross every day on their way to work, school, and play.")
