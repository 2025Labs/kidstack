			As engineers keep pushing the limits to make things taller, faster, stronger and better, they often have to develop new ideas to take things to the next level.  In Orlando, Fla., engineers are pushing the limits of roller coasters using new structural engineering ideas.
			<br><br>

			The current tallest roller coaster in the world is called Kingda Ka and is at Six Flags in New Jersey.  According to the Six Flags website, this roller coaster is 456 feet tall and reaches speeds of 128 miles per hour, but lasts under a minute. To be able to top this giant, engineers from US Thrill Rides have come up with new ideas to support tracks at higher heights and to create a longer journey for the riders.  The result of their efforts is the new roller coaster called "Skyscraper".

			<br><br>

			Opening in 2017, Skyscraper will stand over 570 feet tall. Lasting almost four minutes, this ride will be full of twists and dives to keep riders excited. To support this massive track, engineers came up with a new way to support this ride.  Engineers will be using an actual skyscraper as the structural support!  Structures are all load bearing objects, and this building is no exception. 
			<br><br> 

			In the case of this roller coaster, the skyscraper will need to support the weight of the building and the roller coaster track, cars and riders.  Also, Skyscraper will plan its twists and turns to rotate around the outside of the building, giving people inside a great view of those riding the coaster. Engineers are using as much of the building as they can to make the roller coaster safer and more fun for those watching and those riding it.
			<br><br>

			There will be many structural engineers making sure that all of the forces being put on this tall building will be supported and that the roller coaster will be safe to ride. Engineers don't just solve problems, they also make our world more fun. Take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gK5MWQ__Ns" target="_blank">virtual tour</a> on the coaster!

			<div class="eitn_title">Failure Analysis: Learning from our Mistakes</div>

			We have all had times when we have experienced failure.  Everything canâ€™t go perfectly all the time.  Engineering is no exception.  Mistakes are just as much a part of the engineering field as success.  No major discovery or success can be made without months or years of trial and error. The important thing is that we learn from our failure, so we don't make the same mistakes again. In engineering, this is done through failure analysis.

			<br><br>
			Scientist and engineers are using failure analysis right now on two different spacecraft that failed in the past few weeks.  The first spacecraft was an unmanned rocket that blew up just seconds after takeoff.  This rocket was meant to bring supplies up to astronauts in the space station.

			<br><br>
			
			The second spacecraft was a space plane that was supposed to be used for space tourism in the future.  The space plane, created by Virgin Galactic, exploded over the desert during a test flight. 

			<br><br>
		
			Just minutes after both of these crashes occurred, engineers had to put asside their disappointment and sadness and begin to look at what went wrong. To figure out what went wrong with the rocket, engineers will have to mainly use video and data they took during the launch since the explosion destroyed a large amount of rocket.  This is where engineers have to use their problem-solving skills and adapt to fit the situation.

			<br><br>
		
			For the space plane, more information is available since parts of the plane were able to be collected.  This plane was still going through testing, so lots of data was being taken.   According to the BBC, one possible cause of the crash was a special part of the tail of the plane coming out too early. These tails make the plane slow down.  This was discovered through failure analysis. 
		
			<br><br>

			Since both of these accidents occurred recently, engineers are not yet exactly sure what happened to cause them.  In the weeks or months to come, engineers will continue to perform failure analysis and to find the causes of the accidents and how to prevent them in the future.  We must learn from our mistakes and use them to help make our technology better and safer.
