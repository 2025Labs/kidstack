			<div class="eitn_title">3D Printing - Improving the Medical World</div>

			3D Printers print solid objects that you can eat, wear, and stand on. Imagine being able to print an actual pizza from a picture found on a computer. This is what 3-dimensional printing is allowing us to do. 3D printers create three dimensional objects of a digital picture. They print with materials rather than with the ink 2D printers use. One thin layer is placed on top of another until the solid object is made.    
			<br><br>

			The object is either designed from scratch or scanned using a 3D scanner. The software for this process separates the digital picture into many horizontal layers. You can think of each layer as a two-dimensional image. The printer then reads and prints each layer. Guitars, car parts, and bikinis have been 3D printed. These printers are also helping people in a big way. Replacement bones and body parts can now be printed, and this is just the beginning. Looking to the future, this technology has many promising possibilities in the medical world.
