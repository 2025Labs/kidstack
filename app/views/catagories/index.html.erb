			<div class="eitn_title">Failure Analysis: Learning from our Mistakes</div>
			<div class="eitn_author">By ERIN WINICK, President, University of Florida Society of Women Engineers and Mechanical Engineering Student</div>


			We have all had times when we have experienced failure.  Everything canâ€™t go perfectly all the time.  Engineering is no exception.  Mistakes are just as much a part of the engineering field as success.  No major discovery or success can be made without months or years of trial and error. The important thing is that we learn from our failure, so we don't make the same mistakes again. In engineering, this is done through failure analysis.

			<br><br>
			Scientist and engineers are using failure analysis right now on two different spacecraft that failed in the past few weeks.  The first spacecraft was an unmanned rocket that blew up just seconds after takeoff.  This rocket was meant to bring supplies up to astronauts in the space station. <%= link_to ("Read more..."), news_path  %>
